         <h3>I'm Angus.</h3>
         <p>But you can call me <em>Mango</em>. Welcome to my personal site &ndash; a bit 2003, but it turns out that's all you need.</p>
         <p>Recently moved to <em>Vancouver</em> after 6 years in London. It's wet (famously), but it's an amazing city. It keeps me active &ndash; follow me on <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.strava.com/athletes/16689678">Strava</a> to see which trails I've been visiting recently!</p>
         <p>I'm currently working for <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.mastercard.com/news/">Mastercard</a> in a strategy & operations role. Often working on our <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.paymentsdive.com/news/mastercard-plans-payments-push/609910/">enterprise strategy</a>, sometimes <a target = "_blank" href = "https://www.wsj.com/articles/mcdonalds-to-sell-digital-startup-dynamic-yield-to-mastercard-11640096590">acquisition opportunities</a>, and with a few shots of product management and marketing for good measure. I recently started up a Tech Leadership Network for our 250-person Vancouver Tech Hub &ndash; <em>I'd love to hear from you if you're local</em>.</p>
         <!-- <p>Before Mastercard, I spent 4 (formative!) years at Applied Predictive Technologies.</p> -->
         <p>For 5 years I sat on the Board of Directors for Data Driven Charities, a data-for-good philanthropic organisation. I reviewed dozens of project proposals, and together <em>we distributed $200K to non-profits looking to improve their impact through the use of data</em>. The best part was the follow-up &ndash; hearing about our grant recipients' project progress and measurable impact.</p>
         <p>Also, <em>talk to me about maths</em> &ndash; I spent 4 years studying it (mostly applied). Statistics for networks, fluid dynamics, statistical mechanics, Black-Scholes, stochastics for biology, and a bit of machine learning. The IMA published a paper I authored on the origins of group theory. My one wish: that I'd completed a joint honours with computer science or philosophy.</p>
